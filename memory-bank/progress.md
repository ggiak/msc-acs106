# Progress: IoT Temperature & Humidity Monitoring System

## 1. What Works

-   **Complete System Functionality**: The entire end-to-end system is now working as expected.
    -   The Docker containers for Mosquitto and Node-RED start and run correctly.
    -   The Python virtual environment is set up, and all dependencies are installed.
    -   The IoT device simulator runs without errors and publishes data to the MQTT broker.
    -   The Node-RED server processes the data and displays it on the dashboard.
    -   The web dashboard is accessible and shows real-time data.
-   **System Verification**: The `test_system.py` script now passes all tests, confirming that all components are correctly configured and communicating with each other.

## 2. What's Left to Build

-   The core functionality of the project is complete. There are no major features left to build at this time.
-   Future enhancements could include:
    -   Adding more sensor types (e.g., light, pressure).
    -   Implementing a more sophisticated anomaly detection system.
    -   Adding user authentication to the dashboard.
    -   Persisting historical data to a time-series database.

## 3. Current Status

-   **Stable**: The project is in a stable, working state.
-   **Documented**: The initial Memory Bank documentation has been created.

## 4. Known Issues

-   There are no known issues at this time.
