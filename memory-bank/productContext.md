# Product Context: IoT Temperature & Humidity Monitoring System

## 1. Problem Statement

The primary problem this project addresses is the need for a simple, reliable, and real-time system for monitoring environmental conditions (temperature and humidity) in a given space. The system also needs to provide a critical safety feature: an automated fire detection and alert mechanism. This is a common requirement in many environments, from server rooms to laboratories to residential homes.

## 2. Target Audience

The primary audience for this project is students and developers who are learning about IoT systems. It provides a practical, hands-on example of a complete end-to-end IoT solution, from sensor to dashboard.

## 3. User Experience Goals

- **Easy Deployment**: The system should be easy to set up and run, thanks to Docker containerization.
- **Real-time Insights**: The dashboard should provide an immediate, at-a-glance view of the current temperature and humidity, as well as historical trends.
- **Clear Alerts**: Fire and other anomaly alerts should be clear, prominent, and easy to understand.
- **Accessible**: The dashboard should be accessible from any web browser on the local network.
