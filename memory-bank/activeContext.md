# Active Context: IoT Temperature & Humidity Monitoring System

## 1. Current Focus

The current focus is on ensuring the project is fully functional, well-documented, and easy to understand for future development. The immediate task was to fix the initial setup issues and create a baseline documentation set.

## 2. Recent Changes

-   **File Structure**: Moved all project files from the `iot-project/` subdirectory to the root directory.
-   **Python Environment**: Created a Python virtual environment (`venv`) to manage dependencies and resolve `externally-managed-environment` errors.
-   **Dependencies**: Installed all required Python packages (`paho-mqtt`, `numpy`, `requests`) into the virtual environment.
-   **Test Script**: Updated the `test_system.py` script to use the correct file paths and to remove a call to a non-existent `__version__` attribute.
-   **Documentation**: Created the initial Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`).

## 3. Next Steps

-   Create the `progress.md` file to complete the initial Memory Bank setup.
-   Review and update the existing project documentation (`README.md`, `HOW_TO_RUN.md`, etc.) to reflect the changes made.
-   Perform a final validation of the system to ensure all components are working as expected.

## 4. Key Learnings

-   The local Python environment can have specific restrictions (e.g., `externally-managed-environment`) that require the use of a virtual environment.
-   Test scripts must be updated to reflect changes in the project's file structure.
-   It's important to verify the existence of attributes before accessing them in Python scripts to avoid `AttributeError` exceptions.
